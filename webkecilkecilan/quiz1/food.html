        <h4>Tahu Takwa</h4>
        <p>Kediri is widely known as the "City of Tofu," and its most iconic
          culinary specialty is Tahu Takwa. This yellow-colored tofu has a firm 
          texture on the outside yet remains soft on the inside. It is made from 
          high-quality soybeans and is usually marinated with turmeric, which 
          gives it its distinctive golden color. Tahu Takwa can be enjoyed in many 
          ways: fried until crispy, cooked in soup, or served as a side dish with 
          rice and sambal. Its savory taste and unique texture make it a must-try dish 
          when visiting Kediri.</p>
        <h4>Nasgor Arang</h4>
        <p>The rice is usually stir-fried with a mixture of sweet soy sauce, 
          shallots, garlic, eggs, chicken or beef slices, and fresh vegetables. 
          The smoky flavor blends perfectly with the rich seasonings, creating a 
          nostalgic and authentic taste that has been loved for generations.</p>
